# Observability Incident Response

## Failed Scrape Targets

1. Open Prometheus targets on VM2 and identify whether the failure is isolated to one job or one machine.
2. Confirm basic network reachability from VM2 to the target port.
3. For VM1, prioritize `vm1-postgres`, `vm1-minio`, and `vm1-node` before lower-priority targets.
4. If the target is a player and direct scrape is optional at the site, confirm whether the player target should remain in `players.targets.json` at all.
5. Silence only the specific alert that matches the maintenance window. Do not silence broad platform alerts without a written reason.

## Grafana Unavailable

1. Confirm VM3 nginx is up and still proxies `/grafana/` to the local Grafana port.
2. Check the Grafana container logs and confirm the provisioned datasource still points to VM2 Prometheus.
3. Confirm Prometheus is reachable from VM3 before restarting Grafana.
4. If Grafana remains unavailable, CMS summary views should still work. Treat this as degraded observability, not immediate signage downtime, unless operators lose all required visibility.

## Prometheus Unavailable

1. Treat Prometheus loss on VM2 as a critical observability incident.
2. Confirm the container is running and the rendered config files still exist in the active release folder.
3. Validate the current config and rules with `scripts/verify/validate-observability-assets.sh` from the build machine or a matching repo checkout.
4. If the failure started after a config update, roll back to the previous validated release folder.
5. Restore historical data only after Prometheus is healthy again.

## VM1 Capacity Pressure

1. Treat VM1 storage pressure as urgent because it impacts both PostgreSQL and MinIO.
2. Confirm which filesystem is filling and whether Docker volumes or MinIO objects are the dominant consumer.
3. Stop non-essential ingest or retention-increasing tasks before deleting data.
4. If the filesystem alert is near saturation, expand storage or move data before restarting dependent services.

## Backend Metrics Missing

1. Confirm `signhex-server` is reachable on VM2 and `/metrics` still binds to the expected local or management interface.
2. Check whether the backend process is healthy but the `/metrics` access policy changed.
3. If the scrape is blocked only by config drift, restore the expected bind or token config instead of broadening exposure.
4. Use CMS summary APIs as a fallback current-state view while the Prometheus scrape path is being restored.

## Player Metrics Missing

1. Check whether the site has approved direct player scrape. If not, missing player scrape metrics are not a production incident by themselves.
2. If direct scrape is approved, confirm the player bind address, firewall rules, and `players.targets.json` entry.
3. If a player remains unreachable, remove or comment the target only when the player is intentionally decommissioned.
4. Backend heartbeat-derived screen state remains the primary operator signal; do not block playback recovery on scrape-only issues.

## Rule Validation During Upgrades

1. Run `scripts/verify/validate-observability-assets.sh` before copying any updated rules or dashboards.
2. Re-run the same validation after rendering environment-specific values for production or QA.
3. Do not restart Prometheus or Alertmanager with unvalidated rule or config changes.

## Offline Image And Config Updates

1. Load all required images before touching running containers.
2. Copy rendered config and dashboard changes into the new release folder.
3. Restart only the affected observability component in dependency order.
4. Keep the previous validated release folder intact until the updated stack is confirmed healthy.
